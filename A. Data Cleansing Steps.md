 # ๐ SQL_CHALLENGE_DATA-MART

## ๐งผ Solution - A. Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
- Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
- Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:  

| segment | demographic | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
- Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

**Answer:**

## Create New Table `clean_weekly_sales`

Let's construct the structure of `clean_weekly_sales` table and lay out the actions to be taken.

_`*` represent new columns_

| Columns | Actions to take |
| ------- | --------------- |
| week_date | Convert to `DATE` using `TO_DATE`
| week_number* | Extract number of week using `DATE_PART` 
| month_number* | Extract number of month using `DATE_PART` 
| calendar_year* | Extract year using `DATE_PART`
| region | No changes
| platform | No changes
| segment | No changes
| age_band* | Use `CASE WHEN` and based on `segment`, 1 = `Young Adults`, 2 = `Middle Aged`, 3/4 = `Retirees` and null = `Unknown`
| demographic* | Use `CASE WHEN` and based on `segment`, C = `Couples` and F = `Families` and null = `Unknown`
|customer_type| No changes
| transactions | No changes
| avg_transaction* | Divide `sales` with `transactions` and round up to 2 decimal places
| sales | No changes

**Answer:**

````sql
drop table if exists clean_weekly_sales;
select 
CONVERT(date,week_date,3) as week_date,
DATEPART(week,CONVERT(date,week_date,3)) as week_number,
DATEPART(month,CONVERT(date,week_date,3)) as month_number,
DATEPART(YEAR,CONVERT(date,week_date,3)) as calendar_year,
region,
platform,
segment,
case when right(segment,1)='1' then 'Young Adults'
	 when RIGHT(segment,1)='2' then 'Middle Aged'
	 when RIGHT(segment,1) in ('3','4') then 'Retirees'
	 else 'Unknown' end as age_band,
case when LEFT(segment,1)='C' then 'Couples'
	 when LEFT(segment,1)='F' then 'Families'
	 else 'Unknown' end as demographic,
customer_type,
transactions,
ROUND(cast(sales as float)/transactions,2) as avg_transaction,
sales
into clean_weekly_sales
from weekly_sales;
